# PomodoroTimer
This was a project done with instructions throughout the RocketSeat Explorer course, of a Pomodoro Timer, with JS, HTML and CSS.

I used multiple javascript techiniques, mostly changing HTML classes to do certain aspects of my project, like dark mode, or playing/stopping the counting, setting the time for the counter or playing/stopping the music.

The project is available at: [https://pomodoro-timer-indol.vercel.app/](https://pomodoro-timer-indol.vercel.app/)
